# About

Just a quick mock up of what we talked about today. Where we left it really wasn't sitting with me well. So I roughly hacked this out ~30 mins before hopping on to bart. Hope this is closer to what you were looking for!

To run a simulated poker game:

```
python quickPokerSpinUp.py 

```


# Caveats

Not all edge cases are currently not covered :(

### Backlog of issues:

- Validate num players at beginning to ensure valid game
- Points system needs to be studied and reconfigured
- Decouple suites into its own component
- Write mapper to give meaning to numerical values of cards
- etc.

Would cover them given more time ;)
